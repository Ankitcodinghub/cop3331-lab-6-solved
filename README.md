Submission Instructions:

1. Create a folder named Lab6 LastName FirstInitial (e.g. Lab6 Neal T).

2. In your folder, place a PDF file containing your answers to questions with a ‚ô¶.

4. Ensure that all programs have block comments at the very beginning (starting at the first line) in the file containing main() with your name and the program‚Äôs description. The block comment‚Äôs format should be identical to what‚Äôs provided in Figure 2-1.

5. Use single-line comments to describe your code‚Äôs functionality as needed.

6. Do not submit anything for questions with a ‚ô£.

7. Zip the folder and submit it via Canvas.

‚ô¶ = 5 points each, ‚ô† = 15 points each

1. ‚ô£ Read Chapter 14: How to define classes.

2. ‚ô¶ Encapsulation allows you to control access to

a. the member functions of an object

b. the data members of an object

c. the helper functions of an object

d. the private members of an object

3. ‚ô¶ A helper function is a member function

a. whose definition is coded in the header file for the class

b. whose function calls are replaced by the code in the function itself

c. that overloads another member function

d. that can only be used by other member functions

4. ‚ô¶ You can code a default constructor that

a. accepts no parameters

b. accepts parameters with default values

c. doesn‚Äôt initialize one or more data members

d. all of the above

e. a and c only

5. ‚ô¶ Which of the following is an advantage of using an inline function?

a. You don‚Äôt have to recompile the header file that contains the function if you change the implementationcode for the function.

b. The compiler always replaces each call to the function with the code for the function, resulting in reducedoverhead.

c. The code for the function is more concise because it‚Äôs declared and defined in one place.d. all of the above

e. a and c only

6. ‚ô¶ You can use UML to

a. create diagrams for the classes of an object-oriented program

b. create diagrams of the function hierarchy of an object-oriented program

c. convert diagrams into source code

d. all of the above

e. a and b only

7. ‚ô¶ Which members of the following class are private?

class Employee { string name; double salary; double to_hourly(double);

void set_name(string); string get_name(); void set_salary(double); double get_salary();

double get_weekly_salary(); double get_monthly_salary();

}

a. all of them

b. all of them except for the getter and setter functions

c. all of the data members, but none of the member functions

d. none of them

8. ‚ô† Project: Rectangle Calculator

Create an object-oriented program that performs calculations on a rectangle. Save in folder lab6-q8.

Console

Rectangle Calculator

Height: 10

Width: 20

Perimeter: 60

Area: 200

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

* *

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Continue? (y/n): y

Height: 5

Width: 10

Perimeter: 30

Area: 50

* * * * * * * * * *

* *

* *

* *

* * * * * * * * * *Continue? (y/n): n Bye!

Specifications

‚Ä¢ Use a Rectangle class that provides data members and corresponding getter and setter functions to store the height and width of a rectangle. This class should also provide member functions that calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle as well as a member function that gets a string representation of the rectangle.

‚Ä¢ Store the Rectangle class in a header file and a corresponding implementation file.

‚Ä¢ When the program starts, it should prompt the user for height and width. Then, it should create a Rectangle object from the height and width and use the member functions of that object to get the perimeter, area, and string representation of the object.

9. ‚ô† Project: Card Dealer

Create an object-oriented program that creates a deck of cards, shuffles them, and deals the specified number of cards to the player. Save in folder lab6-q9.

Console

Card Dealer I have shuffled a deck of 52 cards. How many cards would you like?: 7

Here are your cards:

Jack of Hearts

Jack of Diamonds

2 of Diamonds

6 of Spades

Jack of Spades

6 of Hearts

King of Diamonds There are 45 cards left in the deck.

Good luck!

Specifications

‚Ä¢ Use a Card class to store the rank and suit for each card. In addition, use a member function to get a string representation for each card such as ‚ÄúAce of Spades‚Äù, ‚Äú2 of Spades‚Äù, etc.

‚Ä¢ Use a Deck class to store the 52 cards in a standard playing deck (one card for each rank and suit):

Ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace

Suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades

This class should include a member function that shuffles the deck, a member function that counts the number of cards in the deck, and a member function that deals a card from the deck, which should reduce the count of the cards in the deck by 1.

‚Ä¢ Store the Card and Deck classes in separate header and implementation files.

‚Ä¢ When the program starts, it should get a new deck of cards, shuffle them, and display a message that indicates the total number of cards in the deck. To shuffle the cards, you can use the shuffle function of the random module described in chapter 6.

‚Ä¢ The program should prompt the user for the desired number of cards. Then, it should deal the user the desired number of cards and display a message that indicates the number of cards left in the deck.

10. ‚ô† Create UML diagrams for the Card and Deck classes in Lab6 Q9.
